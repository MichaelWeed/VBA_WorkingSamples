# VBA_WorkingSamples
This is a repository of working or 'in-use' scripts written in Visual Basic for Applications, for $CurrentOrganization.

Each Module is self-contained but makes calls to a Helper Module.  All reports come from Cisco Unified Information Center and BoldChat reports. NICE's inContact will come later.

## NOTE:  You must use the default, standard forms.  Do not use custom forms, or you are going to have a bad time.
